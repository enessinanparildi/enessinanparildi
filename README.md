## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Enes Sinan Parildi - Machine Learning & AI Engineer

About Me

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in deep learning, NLP, and LLM. My primary expertise lies in building applications using LLMs such as Gemini, Llama, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT, as well as more traditional ML algorithms for tasks such as clustering and multi-label classification. Additionally, I am passionate about Bayesian models, reinforcement learning, uncertainty quantification, kernel methods, and applying various active learning and metric learning techniques.

I am currently open to work and looking for exciting opportunities in AI and machine learning.
